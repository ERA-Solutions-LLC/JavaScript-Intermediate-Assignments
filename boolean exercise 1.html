<!--
  Your task is to fill in the code inside the isEligibleToVote() function to check if the person's age is greater than or equal to the voting age using boolean logic. For example, you can set the voting age threshold to 18 for this exercise. If the person's age is greater than or equal to 18, the function should return true, indicating that the person is eligible to vote. Otherwise, it should return false.

Once you've filled in the code, you can open the HTML file in a web browser and test the program by entering different ages to see if the person is eligible to vote or not.
